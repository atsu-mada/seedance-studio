## Seen, not told

Seven scenes, seven prompts, five languages. Each is a complete fifteen-second story: the
situation legible by shot two, a reversal, and a hold on whoever lost, cut like short drama in
four or five shots. Each clip is generated on Seedance 2.0 from the exact prompt beneath it:
text to video, no reference assets, one take, no post work. Above each prompt sits the kind of
brief people usually type, so the difference is visible before it is explained. Every prompt
went through the [moderation pre-screen](references/moderation-prescreen.md) before publication,
because a classifier refuses words, not intent, and every prompt is [directed for the
model](references/direct-for-the-model.md): one action per shot while everyone else keeps
living, reactions written as a feeling plus one physical anchor, prop work written as a hand,
and a lock line closing every shot that restates the light, the people and where they stand,
because the model keeps nothing across a cut that the prompt does not repeat. Each prompt was
rendered from a [shot table](references/shot-table.md) that is published beside it, so the
geometry can be checked on paper before a take is paid for. Where a clip has not been rendered
yet, its slate stands in its place.

#### Clip 01: By appointment only

<sub>English · 15 s · 16:9 · storyboard · slate: not rendered yet · ladder: Stretch: 4.5 beats (one insert at half), load 3, S = 2.0</sub>

**What people usually type:** *rich woman disguised as poor gets humiliated at luxury store, plot twist, satisfying, cinematic, 4k*

**What you know by shot two:** Shot one is a soaked woman in work clothes stopped inside a boutique door by a voice that says appointment only; shot three is a phone call that says the new owner is standing in the shop.

<details>
<summary>The prompt the skill wrote</summary>

> Shot 1. Wide shot from the back of a hushed luxury boutique looking toward the glass front
> door, on a rainy afternoon: cream carpet, glass shelves of shoes along the left wall, the
> counter on the right with two assistants in black behind it, one folding tissue paper, one
> glancing up at the door. A woman pushes the glass door open, steps inside dripping, and stops
> on the mat, water running off her sleeves. From just off frame right, by the counter, the
> manager's voice, polite and thin: "We're by appointment only, ma'am." She turns her head
> toward the voice, calm, almost amused, and says nothing. Light: soft grey daylight from the
> front window, warm spotlights on the shelves. The woman: thirties, dark hair tied back, white
> overalls stained with paint, tan work boots, standing just inside the door, facing into the
> shop. Camera at the back of the shop, facing the door.
>
> Shot 2. Cut to a medium shot from the counter side: she walks across the carpet to the white
> display chaise in the middle of the shop, sits down on it facing the counter, crosses one
> muddy boot over the other, and looks slowly along the shelves, unhurried. Behind her the two
> assistants exchange a glance. Same light: soft grey daylight from the front window, warm
> spotlights on the shelves. The woman: thirties, dark hair tied back, white overalls stained
> with paint, tan work boots, seated on the white chaise in the middle of the shop, facing the
> counter. Camera on the counter side.
>
> Shot 3. Cut to a close shot of the manager from the chaise side, standing by the counter, a
> phone at his ear, listening. Embarrassed, the polite smile fades and he swallows; then he says
> quietly: "Yes, sir. The new owner is... standing in the shop now." His eyes go past the camera
> to her, off frame, and stay there. Same light: soft grey daylight from the front window, warm
> spotlights on the shelves. The manager: fifties, grey suit, steel-rimmed glasses, standing by
> the counter, facing the chaise. Camera on the chaise side.
>
> Shot 4. Cut to a two-shot from behind the chaise, her shoulder in the foreground, the manager
> by the counter and the wall of shoes beyond him: she lifts one arm and points at a single pair
> of shoes on the wall; he walks from the counter to the wall and lifts that pair down with both
> hands, careful now. Same light: soft grey daylight from the front window, warm spotlights on
> the shelves. The woman: thirties, dark hair tied back, white overalls stained with paint, tan
> work boots, seated on the chaise, facing the counter. The manager: fifties, grey suit,
> steel-rimmed glasses, walking from the counter to the wall of shoes. Camera behind the chaise.
>
> Shot 5. Cut to a close insert of the cream carpet: a trail of wet bootprints from the door to
> the chaise, rain running down the glass door behind. Hold on the bootprints. Same light: soft
> grey daylight from the front window. Camera low over the carpet, facing the door.

#### Clip 02: Hold the line

<sub>English · 15 s · 16:9 · storyboard · slate: not rendered yet · ladder: Stretch: 4 beats, load 3, S = 2.1</sub>

**What people usually type:** *epic storm at sea, fisherman fights giant wave, slow motion, dramatic music, 8k*

**What you know by shot two:** Shot two tells the audience what the rope is worth: an off-screen voice says it is only a boat, and his answer says whose boat.

<details>
<summary>The prompt the skill wrote</summary>

> Shot 1. Wide shot from the landward end of a wooden pier at night in a storm, looking out
> along it: a small fishing boat straining at a single mooring rope off the far end, its bow
> lifting and slamming with each swell, rain driven sideways through one sodium lamp, and behind
> the boat a wave building higher than the mast. At the far end of the pier a man leans back
> against the rope with both hands, boots sliding on the wet planks, holding on, his back to the
> camera. Light: one orange sodium lamp on its post at the end of the pier, black water beyond,
> nothing else. The man: forties, short beard streaked grey, yellow oilskin with the hood down,
> black rubber boots, at the end of the pier with the rope in both hands, facing the boat.
> Camera at the landward end.
>
> Shot 2. Cut to a medium shot at deck height from the side of the pier: the man has both hands
> on the rope, boots braced against a cleat, arms shaking with the strain, the rope creaking as
> the boat pulls. From the dark behind the camera, landward, a voice shouts over the wind: "Let
> it go, Tom! It's only a boat!" He hears it, keeps his eyes on the rope, and his grip tightens.
> Same light: one orange sodium lamp overhead, black water beyond. The man: forties, short beard
> streaked grey, yellow oilskin with the hood down, black rubber boots, braced at the cleat,
> facing the boat. Camera at his side.
>
> Shot 3. Cut to a close shot of his face from in front of him, the boat behind the camera: rain
> running off his brow, eyes on the rope, teeth clenched; without turning his head he shouts
> back over his shoulder, angry and close to tears: "It's my father's!" Same light: one orange
> sodium lamp overhead, black water beyond. The man: forties, short beard streaked grey, yellow
> oilskin with the hood down, braced at the cleat, facing the boat. Camera in front of him.
>
> Shot 4. Cut to a low angle from the pier planks in front of him, looking up at him with the
> boat's bow behind him: the wave breaks over the end of the pier and buries him in white water.
> When the water drains through the planks he is still there, bent double and coughing, both
> hands on the rope, the rope taut, the boat still there behind him. Hold on this frame as the
> next swell lifts the bow. Same light: one orange sodium lamp overhead, black water beyond. The
> man: forties, short beard streaked grey, yellow oilskin with the hood down, black rubber
> boots, still braced at the cleat, facing the boat. Camera low, in front of him.

How the clips are made, the settings, the internal read behind each prompt and the render record are in the [front-page clip brief](https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0/blob/main/docs/FRONT_PAGE_CLIPS.md). A rendered clip proves that one take; it is not a promise about the next one.

## Start Here

After installation, tell your agent what happens and what must stay fixed:

> Use seedance-20. A person finishes a paper fan at a workbench. Keep it quiet,
> with one static shot and no music. Give me the prompt only.

One possible draft:

```text
Locked tabletop shot. Two hands
finish the last fold of a paper
fan and let go. The fan settles
on the wood. Hold still for one
beat. Warm desk-lamp light;
dry paper rustle and room tone.
No music.
```

**Why these choices:** one visible action, a clear endpoint, a fixed camera and
an explicit sound choice. Duration and aspect ratio belong in your provider's
controls when that surface owns them. This is an unrendered teaching example;
it does not establish successful folding, motion or audio generation.

For another treatment, choose calm observation, a playful gag or a step-by-step
demonstration. Tell the agent which one you want to keep. A draft can be revised
without submitting a paid generation request.

<!-- teaching-image:placement -->
<!-- installed-readme-gallery:start -->

![Slender hands with long pearl-blush nails, ivory tips and gold accents hold an ivory paper fan under a desk lamp.](assets/paper-fan-teaching.png)

*AI-generated teaching concept, not Seedance output.* The still illustrates
material, framing and light; it does not prove the action or sound will render.

[product and process](references/product-example-cards.md),
[reference and continuity](references/continuity-example-cards.md).

## Choose a workflow

| What you have | What to provide next |
|---|---|
| A rough idea | The action, feeling and delivery format; ask for a few distinct choices. |
| A prompt to improve | The draft and constraints you want preserved. |
| Image, video or audio references | Actual files and the role each should control. |
| An accepted clip to continue | Its observed ending and the next action. |
| A result that missed | The failed requirement and your remaining revision budget. |

Start with the [quickstart](docs/QUICKSTART.md),
[reference workflow](references/reference-workflow.md),
[continuation guide](skills/seedance-continuation/SKILL.md) or
[retake protocol](references/retake-protocol.md).

## Install

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section installs the unchanged upstream `seedance-20` skill from
> `Emily2040/seedance-2.0`. To install this fork's `seedance-studio` skill, follow
> [`seedance-studio/README.md`](seedance-studio/README.md#install) instead.

Get a local copy, then run the installer from that folder. This example selects
Codex user scope; other clients are in the table below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0.git
cd seedance-2.0
python scripts/install_codex_skill.py --client codex --scope user
```

Download ZIP also works: extract it and run the installer inside that folder.
Restart your client, then select `seedance-20`. Review the
[security policy](SECURITY.md) before configuring optional provider tools.
Prompt preparation does not authorize paid generation.

Treat the table below as common local targets to verify in your own client, not a universal support guarantee.

| Platform | Typical install target (verify in your client) |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/seedance-20/` (personal) or `.claude/skills/seedance-20/` (project) — both via `scripts/install_codex_skill.py --dest` |
| Codex | project `.agents/skills/seedance-20/` or user `~/.agents/skills/seedance-20/`; no-option installer keeps its historical path |
| Google Antigravity | `.agents/skills/seedance-20/` (workspace) or `~/.gemini/config/skills/seedance-20/` (global across Antigravity products) |
| OpenClaw | workspace `skills/seedance-20/` or `~/.openclaw/skills/seedance-20/` via `openclaw skills install` (ClawHub-compatible; skills already carry `openclaw:` metadata) |
| Hermes Agent | `~/.hermes/skills/seedance-20/` (primary); a project `skills/seedance-20/` directory is discovered only after its parent is added to `skills.external_dirs` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` |
| Gemini CLI-style workspace | `.gemini/skills/seedance-20/` |
| GitHub Copilot workspace | `.github/skills/seedance-20/` |
| Cursor workspace | `.cursor/skills/seedance-20/` |
| Windsurf workspace | `.windsurf/skills/seedance-20/` |
| Trae (ByteDance) | `.trae/skills/seedance-20/` |
| Qwen Code (Alibaba) | `.qwen/skills/seedance-20/` or `~/.qwen/skills/seedance-20/` |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/skills/seedance-20/` (also reads `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/`) |
| Amp (Sourcegraph) | `.agents/skills/seedance-20/` or `~/.config/agents/skills/seedance-20/` |
| Goose (Block) | `.agents/skills/seedance-20/` (also `.goose/skills/seedance-20/`) |
| Junie (JetBrains) | `.junie/skills/seedance-20/` or `~/.junie/skills/seedance-20/` |

Several of these clients share the `.agents/skills/` convention — Codex, Google Antigravity, OpenCode, Amp, and Goose all read it — so one install under `.agents/skills/seedance-20/` can serve them together, and `.claude/skills/` is read by many as a compatibility path. Install once as the `seedance-20` root skill; its sub-skills and references resolve by relative path.

<details>
<summary>Installation by client, replacement and recovery details</summary>

Client support for Agent Skills is still tool-specific. See [observed compatibility and the host smoke protocol](https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0/blob/main/docs/HOST_COMPATIBILITY.md) for tested revisions and explicit gaps. Codex documents a skill as a directory with a required `SKILL.md`, optional `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`, and optional `agents/` metadata.

Codex scans `.agents/skills` locations from the working directory upward, plus user/admin/system skill locations. A repository root with `SKILL.md` is shaped like a skill folder, but it still needs to be installed/copied under a scanned skills directory or distributed as a plugin for automatic discovery.

### Step 1 — get the files

Every install path below runs from inside a local copy of this repository, so start here:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0.git
cd seedance-2.0
```

Without `git` installed, use the green **Code → Download ZIP** button on the repository page, unzip it, and change into the unzipped folder instead. Nothing else on this page works until one of those two has happened.

### Step 2 — install it into your client

The installer is not Codex-only. Choose a client and scope below, or point `--dest` at another client's documented skills parent directory:

```bash
# Codex — user scope at ~/.agents/skills
python scripts/install_codex_skill.py --client codex --scope user

# Claude Code — personal install at ~/.claude/skills
python scripts/install_codex_skill.py --client claude-code --scope user

# One existing project, outside this source checkout
python scripts/install_codex_skill.py --client codex --scope project --project-root /path/to/project

# Any other client — use its documented skills parent directory
python scripts/install_codex_skill.py --dest /path/to/client/skills
```

Choose either `--dest` or `--client` with `--scope`; project scope requires an
existing `--project-root` and never guesses from your current directory. The
[scope guide](https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0/blob/main/docs/INSTALL_SCOPES.md)
explains the paths. No-option commands preserve the historical
`$CODEX_HOME/skills` or `~/.codex/skills` default for existing workflows; they do
not migrate old copies. Use the same destination options with the read-only
`install_doctor.py` before deciding on replacement.

The command stages and validates the repository before promoting it to
`<dest>/seedance-20`, then prints where it landed. Concurrent installers
sharing that destination are serialized. Add `--force` only to replace a
complete existing install; the previous copy remains available for rollback
until the validated stage is promoted. The durability, recovery and same-account
trust boundaries of that transaction are documented in
[installer internals](https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0/blob/main/docs/INSTALL_INTERNALS.md).
Restart your client afterwards so `seedance-20` appears in its skill list.

Installs skip the quarantined `references/migrated/` history, the image gallery (about 18 MB of PNGs), the test suite, and the network-capable evaluator. The installer replaces the omitted gallery embeds with one repository link, so the installed README does not contain broken local asset targets.

A destination inside this repository is refused rather than attempted because it would mutate the source authority domain while the payload is being authenticated. For a project-local install, run the script from the project you are installing into, by absolute path, as above.

For a client that imports a local skill folder, first prepare the filtered payload in a new staging directory outside this checkout:

```bash
python scripts/install_codex_skill.py --dest /absolute/path/to/new-staging/skills
```

Import the resulting `skills/seedance-20/` folder, or run the installer with
`--dest` set directly to the skills parent directory your client scans. Keep the
directory name `seedance-20` and its relative layout. A raw repository clone or
a client-managed GitHub import may include the evaluator, provider helpers, tests
and archives; it does not carry the installer's filtered-payload guarantee.
Inspect how that client packages files before using a direct import. See
[manual transfer and verification](https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0/blob/main/docs/MANUAL_INSTALL.md).

## Evidence status

- Repository checks cover routing, state, packaging, source integrity and
  declared document structure. Passing them is not a rendered-quality verdict.
- Live model scores and rendered-pilot results remain pending. The
  [comparison protocol](https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0/blob/main/references/outcome-comparison.md)
  and [48-attempt pilot plan](https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0/blob/main/evals/capped-rendered-pilot.md)
  describe how to collect evidence without inventing results.
- Six languages have full pages, quickstarts and vocabulary. Independent
  review is pending for all of them, and the
  [coverage contract](docs/LANGUAGE_COVERAGE.md) currently flags every
  language for review after recent edits. Availability is not parity.
- Provider capabilities are surface-specific and dated. Check the
  [surface matrix](references/platform-surface-matrix.md) before choosing controls.

5. The skill records what actually happened.
6. It writes Clip 02 from the real ending.
7. Repeat until the planned final outcome is reached.

The project state is the source of truth, the clip contract is the current task,
and the prompt is compiled for that task only.

## Model line and platform facts

**This is a Seedance 2.0 skill.** ByteDance's
[official Seedance 2.5 model page](https://seed.bytedance.com/en/seedance2_5)
confirms a separate newer line, and
[Dreamina's official product page](https://dreamina.capcut.com/seedance/seedance-2-5)
says it is live on Dreamina.
Neither primary page gives an exact launch date, and API or other-surface availability was unconfirmed in the 2026-08-01 review.
The 2026-09-07 source review adds that Runway's API catalog now lists
`seedance2_5` separately, which does not establish account entitlement. Every
platform number in this repository is a 2.0 number. Establish which line a
surface runs before quoting one.

Before any factual claim about API availability, upload limits, pricing,
regions or model names, load [`api-status.md`](references/api-status.md) and
check its `last_verified` date. Treat every endpoint, model ID, price,
account requirement, face or reference policy, and output-rights claim as
provider-specific and recheck it live before implementation.

## Validation

<!-- installed-readme-validation:start -->

The validation toolchain supports **CPython 3.11 through 3.13**. CI exercises
both endpoints on Ubuntu and Windows; intermediate CPython 3.12 releases remain
inside the supported range. Python 3.10 and 3.14 are outside this lock's
supported range.

Install the two hash-pinned toolchains once, then run the release suite. The
offline source-metadata check runs with `--enforce-freshness` here so an old
checked-in registry stamp blocks a release; per-pull-request CI omits that flag
because metadata age depends on the calendar, not on the change under test.

```bash
python -m pip install --require-hashes --requirement requirements-validation.lock
python -I -S -B scripts/build_masthead_outlines.py --install-build-deps
```

```bash
python -I -S -B scripts/build_masthead_outlines.py --check
python scripts/validate_repo.py --release
```

`validate_repo.py` resolves the repository from its own file location and does
not call Git, so this also works from a Download ZIP extraction, from a nested
caller directory, and from a path containing spaces.
`python -I -S -B scripts/build_hero.py --check` proves the committed masthead
SVGs still match their generator; it runs in CI. What each check proves, and
what it cannot, is in the
[validation guide](https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0/blob/main/docs/VALIDATION.md).
Schema checks are not lineage proofs. The source-registry check does not fetch URLs
and does not prove that any upstream claim is still true. The architecture stress
gate is a structural gate, not a creativity judge.

### Git checkout-only hygiene

After the archive-safe checks, a maintainer working in a Git checkout should
also run:

```bash
git diff --check
```

This whitespace check requires Git metadata. Do not run it in a Download ZIP
extraction.

### Checked-in source metadata age

Whether `references/source-registry.md` is stale depends on today's date, not
on the change being tested, so it is not asked per pull request. The release
checklist asks it with `--enforce-freshness`, which blocks a release when the
checked-in stamp is older than 30 days, and `source-freshness-review.yml` asks
it every Monday on the default branch, keeping one tracking issue open while the
registry drifts. The job never edits the registry: re-stamping `last_verified`
without re-reading the sources would record a verification that never happened.

Model-in-the-loop evaluation lives outside offline CI. `python scripts/eval_run.py --limit 1`
prints an offline plan without network, credential read or ledger write. A live
run needs `--live`, an explicit `--max-calls` ceiling and a provider key from the
environment, and only a complete run may replace
[`evals/eval-run-ledger.md`](evals/eval-run-ledger.md). The validation guide
documents the frozen source manifest, blind discovery scoring and ledger
publication rules.

## Design Standard

The front page follows an editorial design system rather than default AI
styling: warm ink and paper themes, an outlined serif wordmark with monospace
specification labels, a single amber accent and hairline rules. No gradients,
no glow, no badges, and no camera costume: no viewfinder marks, timecode,
record dots or aspect badges. Tokens and rules live in the
[frontend design system](references/frontend-design-system.md); the manual
acceptance pass is in [README design acceptance](docs/frontend-redesign.md).

The masthead pair is generated from one geometry by
[`scripts/build_hero.py`](scripts/build_hero.py), so the dark and light
variants cannot drift apart, and `python -I -S -B scripts/build_hero.py --check`
proves the committed SVGs still match the generator. The outlined display type
has its own sealed build toolchain: run
`python -I -S -B scripts/build_masthead_outlines.py --install-build-deps` once,
then `--check`; the full trust chain is in the
[masthead build guide](https://github.com/Emily2040/seedance-2.0/blob/main/docs/MASTHEAD_BUILD.md).

The clip gallery follows one rule: a clip on this page is Seedance 2.0 output
rendered from the prompt printed beneath it, captioned with surface, date and
settings, or its slate says it is not rendered yet. Slates are generated from
`data/front-page-clips.json` by `scripts/build_clip_posters.py`, whose
`--check` keeps them in step with the data.

The masthead is served through a `prefers-color-scheme` picture element; the
operating diagram `assets/skill-map.svg` carries its own background so it reads
on both themes. The page must stay readable on GitHub mobile, in dark mode and
at narrow widths. SVG assets carry `<title>` and `<desc>`, use internal CSS
only, and load no external fonts, scripts or resources.
